## Background

Automating project tasks with Makefiles is simple and `make <command>` is _very ergonomic_. Unfortunately, Make syntax is archaic and ill-suited for self-documenting, full-featured command-line interfaces.

Python, however, is built for scripting and paired with [Click] it's easy great command-line interfaces!

This is where Klack comes in. Klak provides a _very minimal_ wrapper around Click which allows it to import a local **Clickfile** providing the ergonomics of a project Makefile, i.e., `klak <command>`, but also provides the ease of Python and power of Click.

## Features

-   Exposes a global interface, `klak`.
-   Auto-loads a local **Clickfile** (form the curren working directory)
-   Allows users to easily append commands to the default, Klak CLI root
-   Allows users to easily append sub-command groups
-   Compatible with [Click Bash completions]
-   Ships with [Click] setup using the recommended [Click Setuptools Integration]
